# Image-Analyzer-and-Question-Generator

Image Analyzer and Question Generator is a Python-based GUI application that leverages advanced AI models to perform intelligent scene analysis on images. By combining state-of-the-art computer vision models (DETR and ViT), the application generates contextually relevant and dynamic questions based on visual content, enhancing understanding and insights from images.

Features:

Image Input Options:
Upload images from your local machine.
Capture images using your webcam.
Intelligent Scene Analysis:
Utilizes DETR for object detection.
Employs ViT for scene understanding and image captioning.
Processes aspects like lighting, composition, and contextual elements.
Dynamic Question Generation:
Automatically generates insightful, context-based questions about the visual content.
Supports multiple analysis styles (Detailed, Creative, Technical, Educational).
Responsive GUI:
Real-time camera integration with multi-threading for smooth performance.
Modern and intuitive interface using CustomTkinter.
